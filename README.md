# About Project  - [See Live Demo](https://64749890cc503575546b2116--funny-tulumba-14e996.netlify.app/)
This is an web code editor and compiler supporting HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The application provides a live preview of the output, allowing users to see how their code renders in a browser in real-time.The code editor is typically divided into multiple panes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to organize and manage code for each language.
# Purpose
Live code editors provide a dynamic and interactive environment for developers to write, share, and test code in real-time. They offer several benefits that can help solve real-world problems for developers and teams:
<h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3> Live code editors allow developers to quickly prototype and experiment with code ideas. It's an excellent tool for trying out different techniques, libraries, or frameworks without the need to set up a local development environment.
<h3>Collaboration</h3> Developers can easily share their code snippets, projects, or prototypes with others by sharing the editor's URL. This is particularly useful for collaboration, code reviews, and getting feedback from team members or the community.
<h3>Cross-browser Testing</h3> Developers can test their code across different browsers and devices using live code editors. This helps ensure that web applications work consistently across various environments.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
